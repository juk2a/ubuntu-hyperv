Extending root partition of Ubuntu 18.04. Hyper-v Quick Create makes a single 10GB partition, which runs out of space quickly.

0. Edit Ubuntu VM settings in Hyper-V: Hardware->SCI Controller->Hard Drive.
Edit Virtual Hard disk (VM must be off). Expand virtual hard disk to the size you wwish.
(For some reason using gparted live image to FIX the allocated disk space in step 4. causes havoc. Instead gparted from Ubuntu image seems to work)
1. Boot, connect and login to Ubuntu
2. Open terminal
3. Install gparted
# sudo apt-get install gparted
4. Open gparted and choose to FIX the allocated disk space.
5. Shut down Ubuntu.
6. Download gparted live image (gparted-live-1.0.x.y-amd64.iso)
7. Edit again VM settings in Hyper-V. Add a DVD drive to the VM under SCSI Controller and insert gparted live image asd Image File for the Media section of DVD Drive.
8. Change the boot setup of VM: Edit Hardware->Firmware. Change boot order to use DVD Drive as the first boot entry.
9. Boot VM. Connect to VM and use defaults for gparted keyboard, language and GUI settings.
10. Run fcsk against the rootfs. (Open parted to shee the partition if you don't know which one)
# e2fsck -f /dev/sdXY
11. Open gparted, select root partition and select resize/move. Extend the partition the available space.
12. Close gparted and shut down the live image.
13. Boot VM (DVD Drive seems to be emptied automatically between boots)
